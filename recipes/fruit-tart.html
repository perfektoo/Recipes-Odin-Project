      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <strong style="margin-left: 24px">Fruit:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (11 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained and patted dry</li>
      <li>5 large fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 ripe kiwi, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>⅓ cup fresh blueberries</li>
      <li>⅓ cup fresh raspberries</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix water and vanilla extract together in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Stir 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour, sugar, and salt together in a
        medium bowl. Cut in butter until mixture forms fine crumbs. Do not
        overmix, or pastry will be tough. Stir in enough vanilla water to pull
        dough together. Chill for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Gently transfer to an 11-inch tart
        pan. Pat dough into place, cutting off edges and aligning pastry along
        the edges of the pan. Freeze pastry shell until firm, at least 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake pastry shell in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10
        minutes. Prick any large bubbles with the tip of a knife. Allow to cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the filling. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl
        with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat sugar, cream cheese,
        and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until smooth. Fold in whipped
        cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread filling into the cooled tart shell, smoothing out to reach the
        edges. Arrange mandarin oranges, strawberries, kiwi slices, and berries
        over the top, covering as much of the filling as possible. Serve
        immediately or store in the refrigerator.
      </li>
    </ol>
